# Overview

This folder contains all the functionality to train an Agent using a discounted incremental update policy.

# Results

Changing the parameters of the model can have a profound impact on the peformance of the model hence why I have multiple training phase.

Having the flexibility to vary the inputs, Agent type and the ability to access against a human was very useful.
